# 3-generated-axial-algebras

This is magma code to acompany the paper

"Enumerating $3$-generated axial algebras of Monster type", by Khasraw, McInroy and Shpectorov

It contains two files.  The first, 4trans_axial.m, builds all the 3-generated 4-transposition groups up to similarity and finds all the faithful actions on axes, tau-maps and shapes on these.  The second, 3gen4trans_script.m, gives functions for sieving for collapsing subalgebras in order to eliminate the majority of shapes.  The remainder can be analysed using the Partial Axial Algebras package.

Note that the code here needs the Partial Axial Algebras package to run.
